            <p>
                The Midas Project is an effort to construct an system that can profit from swing trading. It is created by Mad Atlas/Aidan Scott.
                The best situation is to be able to have asset valuation increase by 5% every month by investing large percentages of total cash
                compared to traditional investing recomendations. This creates a very risky situation, so making a correct prediction is of high
                importance. To create a system that can predict stock price in the near future, an AI in conjunction with traditional technical
                analysis will be used as the prediciton algorithm.

            <p>
                The Goals of the Midas Project are create a system to automate the author's personal swingtrading hobby making it into
                its own business. Even at an increase in assets each month by 1% out proforms the market, and the goal is 5%, so creating
                a small company that offers Midas's trading capability as a service looks profitable. Roanoke Trading would promise a
                percentage of projected gains to the customer based on their controbution. They contribute 100$, the Midas creates a gain
                of 5%, but we promised 4% of their total.
